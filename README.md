## **Introduction**  
The **Battle Royale Game** is a 2D survival shooter developed using **C++** and **SFML**. Inspired by popular battle royale games, this project combines strategic movement, enemy AI, and a shrinking safe zone to deliver an engaging gaming experience.  

The game features a dynamic arena where players must survive against AI-controlled enemies while navigating the ever-shrinking play area. Players must manage movement, avoid threats, and strategically plan their survival.

---

## **Problem Statement**  
Battle royale games are highly popular, but most require extensive resources and complex mechanics. Thereâ€™s a need for a lightweight yet enjoyable 2D battle royale prototype that focuses on core mechanics like movement, enemy AI, and player survival.  

Our challenge is to design a simple yet challenging **Battle Royale Game** that demonstrates strong **OOP principles** in **C++** with **SFML** for graphics and UI.

---

## **Proposed Solution**  
Our Battle Royale Game will offer:  

âœ… **Object-Oriented Design:** Encapsulated classes for Players, Enemies, Game Mechanics, and UI.  
âœ… **SFML Integration:** For rendering sprites, animations, and handling game logic.  
âœ… **Core Gameplay Mechanics:** Movement, enemy tracking, and survival-based gameplay.  
âœ… **Shrinking Safe Zone:** Forces players toward a central point to increase tension.  
âœ… **Visual and Audio Effects:** Basic sound effects for player actions and enemy encounters.  

---

## **Features**  
### **Core Gameplay Mechanics**  
âœ… **Player Movement:** Smooth movement with WASD controls.  
âœ… **Enemy AI:** Enemies that intelligently track the playerâ€™s position.  
âœ… **Safe Zone System:** The safe zone shrinks gradually to pressure players.  
âœ… **Health & Survival Mechanics:** Players lose health if caught outside the safe zone or collide with enemies.  

### **Advanced Features**  
âœ… **Shooting System:** Players can shoot bullets to eliminate enemies.  
âœ… **Dynamic HUD:** Displays health, ammo, and safe zone countdown.  
âœ… **Scoreboard System:** Tracks player survival time and defeated enemies.  
âœ… **Power-ups & Loot:** Items like health packs, armor, and upgraded weapons.

## **Controls**  
ðŸŽ® Keyboard Inputs:  

| **Action**    | **Key** |
|----------------|----------|
| Move Up         | `W`      |
| Move Down       | `S`      |
| Move Left       | `A`      |
| Move Right      | `D`      |
| Shoot           | `Space`  |
| Pause/Resume    | `P`      |
| Exit Game       | `Esc`    |

## **Tools & Technologies**  
ðŸ›  Languages & Libraries:  
- **C++** (Core Logic & OOP Principles)  
- **SFML** (2D Graphics, UI Rendering, and Event Handling)  
- **CMake** (Build System)  

ðŸ“‚ **File Handling**  
- Saving game scores and player stats (optional feature).

---

## **Expected Outcome**  
By the end of this project, we aim to develop a functional **2D Battle Royale Game** that effectively demonstrates:  
âœ… Solid **Object-Oriented Programming** principles.  
âœ… Interactive gameplay with smooth player movement and enemy AI.  
âœ… A visually appealing interface with responsive controls.
