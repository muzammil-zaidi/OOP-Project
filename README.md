### **Introduction**
Head Tail Hand-Cricket is a 2D digital adaptation of a widely played hand-cricket game among Pakistani teenagers. The game replicates the essence of cricket without requiring complex settings or equipment. It uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in **C++**, integrating **Raylib** for graphics to create an interactive and engaging experience.

The game involves two players:
- **Batsman** â€“ Selects a number (1-6) using their fingers.
- **Bowler** â€“ Selects a number (1-6) to try and get the batsman out.

If both numbers match, the batsman is out; otherwise, the number shown by the batsman is added to their score.

### **Problem Statement**
Traditional hand-cricket is played physically but lacks a digital version that can be easily accessed. The absence of a structured game leads to inconsistency in rules, and existing cricket games are often too complex for casual players who want a quick, lighthearted experience.

The challenge is to build a simple yet engaging **C++ game** using **OOP principles** while integrating **Raylib** for graphics and UI. The game should ensure smooth gameplay, accurate scoring, and a visually appealing interface.

---

### **Proposed Solution**
To solve these challenges, we will develop **Head Tail Hand-Cricket**, featuring:

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Encapsulated classes for Players, Game Mechanics, UI, and Input Handling.
- **Raylib Integration**: A 2D graphical representation of hands, scores, and animations.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Smooth interaction between batsman and bowler with real-time score updates.
- **Minimalist UI**: Aesthetic and user-friendly interface with smooth animations.
- **Scoring System & Game Rules**: Automatic calculation of runs, wickets, and game progression.

### **Features**
#### **Core Gameplay Mechanics**
âœ… **Hand Gesture Input**: Players select numbers (1-6) representing their fingers.  
âœ… **Batsman & Bowler System**: If numbers match, the batsman is out; otherwise, runs are added.  
âœ… **Turn-Based Play**: Players take turns being the batsman and bowler.  
âœ… **Scoreboard Display**: Live updates of the runs and wickets.  

#### **Advanced Features**
âœ… **Graphical Representation**: Animated hands for both players.  
âœ… **Game Modes**:
- Single Player (vs AI)
- Multiplayer (Local)  
âœ… **Sound Effects**: Button clicks, scoring sounds, and "Out!" alerts.  
âœ… **End Game Conditions**: Match ends when wickets run out or a target score is achieved.
